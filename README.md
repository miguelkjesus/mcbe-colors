# mcbe-colors

A library that implements a simple text coloring system for use within the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition script api.

## Examples

Coloring text
```ts
import { aqua }
```

## Installation

If you use a bundler to bundle your behaviour pack scripts, you can simply install this library through npm:

```
npm i @mhesus/mcbe-colors
```

Otherwise, you should copy the source files into your own project. If you use javascript, you should clone this repository and build it by executing the following in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/miguelkjesus/mcbe-commands
cd mcbe-commands
npm run build
```

The javascript files can then be found within the `build/` directory. (Make sure to ignore the `.d.ts` files)
